        "Getting into Dart felt surprisingly approachable coming from TypeScript. The type system is strict and familiar, and the syntax doesn't throw too many surprises. I started by working through the official Dart tour, then moved into small CLI scripts to test the language constructs. The async/await model felt similar to JavaScript, which helped a lot. Where I struggled early on was understanding how Dart's sound null safety works in practice — especially when migrating patterns I knew from JS. Over time, clicking through Flutter's widget tree started making more sense as I understood how Dart classes and constructors compose. I'm currently focused on solidifying OOP principles in Dart before going deeper into Flutter's reactive model.",

I spent a long time on closures and how scope works in JavaScript, which paid off later when understanding React hooks.
